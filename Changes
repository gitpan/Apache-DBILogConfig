Revision history for Perl extension Apache::DBILogConfig.

0.02  Thu Aug 16 22:17:00 2001
	- Fixed error in parsing of DBILogConfig_log_format that caused things to break when
    whitespace was used in parameters.
  - Added support for the following logging formats:
    
    b - bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, in CLF format, i.e. a '-' rather than a 0
        when no bytes are sent
    B - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers (%b used to be the format for this)
    H - The request protocol
    m - The request method
    q - The query string (prepended with a ? if a query string exists, otherwise an empty string)
		
  - Added stubs for future support of:

    A - Local IP-address
		c - Connection status when response is completed
        'X' = connection aborted before the response completed
        '+' = connection may be kept alive after the response is sent
        '-' = connection will be closed after the response is sent
		V - The server name according to the UseCanonicalName setting

		Support for these formats will be completed when mod_perl makes this information available via
    the Apache request, connection and server APIs.
